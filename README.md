# HTML Practice: Favourite Foods and Daily Routine

This is a simple HTML practice project that displays a list of my favourite foods and my daily routine using **HTML headings, lists, and buttons**.

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- How to structure a basic HTML document.
- How to use headings (`<h1>`â€“`<h3>`) to organize content.
- The difference between **ordered lists (`<ol>`)** and **unordered lists (`<ul>`).**
- How to add **buttons** and basic page structure.
